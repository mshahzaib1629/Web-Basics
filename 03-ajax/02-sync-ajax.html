<button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Request data</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

    function loadDoc() {
        /* below line is not safe, as it would not work on IE. */
        /* used only to discuss some other concept */
        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); 

        // false means, we are making synchronous request.
        xhttp.open("GET", "file2.html", false);

        // send() method would return after the AJAX request has completed and response is ready
        xhttp.send();

        // incase of asynchronous requests, we do not need to define handler for onreadystatechange 
        // we can safely define the handler, as defined below, after calling send() method.

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
    }
